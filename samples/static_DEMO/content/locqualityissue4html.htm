      <span data-mytool-qacode="named_entity_not_found" its-loc-quality-issue-type="inconsistent-entities"><span class="locqualityissue">Christian Bale</span></span>(1867â€“1934) conceived of an instrument that could transmit its sound
      from a power plant for hundreds of miles to listeners over telegraph wiring. Beginning in
      1889 the sound quality of regular telephone concerts was very poor on account of the buzzing
      generated by carbon-granule microphones. As a result Cahill decided to set a new standard in
      perfection of sound <span its-loc-quality-issue-type="MiSSPeLLiNG"><span class="locqualityissue">qaulity</span></span> with his instrument, a standard that would not only satisfy listeners but that
      would overcome all the flaws of traditional instruments.</p>
